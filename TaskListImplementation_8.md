## Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Navigation must work properly with DaisyUI dock for mobile and sticky header for desktop
- **IMPORTANT**: Traditional Blade approach means Livewire components are embedded within regular Blade views, not standalone
- **PRIORITY**: All CRUD operations must be fully functional and integrated
- **REQUIREMENT**: Zero Volt implementations should remain after cleanup
- **PATTERN**: Follow Laravel best practices for controller-view-component architecture
- **TESTING**: Each major change must be tested before proceeding to next task
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Use Context7 findings to guide implementation decisions

## Implementation Approach
1. Research first using Context7 for best practices
2. Fix critical navigation issues immediately
3. Systematic audit and rebuild of missing components
4. Traditional Blade-first approach with embedded Livewire components
5. Comprehensive testing and validation

## Expected Outcome
- Fully functional navigation system with proper DaisyUI dock for mobile
- Complete system with all routes, views, and CRUD operations working
- Traditional Blade + Livewire architecture properly implemented
- Clean codebase with no Volt dependencies
- Responsive design working across all device sizes

## Research Findings

### Livewire Best Practices (COMPLETED)
- Traditional Blade + Livewire approach: Livewire components should be embedded within regular Blade views using `<livewire:component-name />`
- Components should NOT use `->layout()` when embedded, they should only return their specific functionality
- Use `wire:navigate` for SPA-like navigation
- Proper component structure: PHP class returns view, Blade view contains only component-specific content
- Single root element per component requirement

### DaisyUI Navigation/Dock (COMPLETED)
- **Dock Component**: Use `dock` class (replaces old `btm-nav`)
- **Dock Sizes**: `dock-sm`, `dock-md`, `dock-xl` for different sizes
- **Active State**: Use `dock-active` class for selected items
- **Dock Structure**: `<div class="dock"><button><svg/><span class="dock-label">Text</span></button></div>`
- **Responsive**: Dock naturally works on mobile, hidden on large screens
- **Sticky Positioning**: Can be positioned with fixed/sticky CSS for bottom navigation
- **Navbar**: Use `navbar` with responsive `dropdown` for mobile and `menu-horizontal` for desktop

### Tailwind CSS Responsive Navigation (COMPLETED)
- **Sticky Positioning**: Use `sticky top-0` for sticky headers that stay visible during scroll
- **Fixed Positioning**: Use `fixed` for elements that stay in place relative to viewport
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes for different screen sizes
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Base styles apply to mobile, use breakpoint prefixes for larger screens
- **Navigation Patterns**: 
  - Mobile: Use `fixed bottom-0` for bottom dock navigation
  - Desktop: Use `sticky top-0` for header navigation
- **Responsive Grid/Flex**: Use `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-6` or `flex flex-col md:flex-row`
- **Viewport Meta Tag**: Essential `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- **Touch Targets**: Use `pointer-coarse:p-4` for larger touch targets on mobile devices

### Implementation Strategy Based on Research
1. **Navigation Structure**: 
   - Mobile: `fixed bottom-0 w-full` dock with DaisyUI dock classes
   - Desktop: `sticky top-0 w-full` header with navbar and menu-horizontal
2. **Responsive Classes**: Use mobile-first approach with appropriate breakpoints
3. **Blade Partials**: Create traditional blade navigation partials instead of Livewire components
4. **Role-based Menu**: Implement conditional navigation based on user roles in blade templates

## Current Progress Status
**✅ Task 1 COMPLETED**: All Context7 documentation research completed successfully
**✅ Task 2 NEARLY COMPLETE**: Navigation system rebuild almost finished
- **✅ Task 2.1 COMPLETED**: Removed Livewire Navigation component entirely (deleted PHP class and Blade view)
- **✅ Task 2.2 COMPLETED**: Created traditional Blade navigation partial with proper DaisyUI dock and responsive design
- **✅ Task 2.3 COMPLETED**: DaisyUI dock properly implemented with `dock dock-md` classes and fixed bottom positioning
- **✅ Task 2.4 COMPLETED**: Sticky header navigation for desktop implemented with `sticky top-0` and `menu-horizontal`
- **✅ Task 2.5 COMPLETED**: Responsive behavior verified (lg:hidden for mobile nav, hidden lg:block for desktop nav), role-based navigation working (Admin vs Staff menus)
- **⭐ Only Task 2.6 remaining**: Test navigation functionality across all device sizes

## Latest Updates
- Successfully removed `app/Livewire/Navigation.php` class
- Successfully removed `resources/views/livewire/navigation.blade.php` view
- Created comprehensive `resources/views/partials/navigation.blade.php` with:
  - **Mobile Navigation**: 
    - Sticky top header (`sticky top-0`) with brand and user dropdown
    - Fixed bottom dock (`fixed bottom-0`) with proper DaisyUI `dock dock-md` classes
    - Role-based navigation items with proper `dock-active` states
    - Dropdown menus positioned upward (`dropdown-top`)
  - **Desktop Navigation**: 
    - Sticky top header (`sticky top-0`) with horizontal menu (`menu-horizontal`)
    - Role-based navigation with collapsible dropdown menus (`details/summary`)
    - Proper active states for all navigation items
  - **Role-based Navigation**: Separate menus for Admin and Staff users
  - **Proper Route Verification**: All navigation routes verified to exist in routes/web.php
- Updated both layout files to use `@include('partials.navigation')` instead of `<livewire:navigation />`

## Route Verification Status ✅
All navigation routes have been verified to exist:
- **Admin Routes**: dashboard, config, categories, products, partners, discounts, reports (sales/stock/expenses)
- **Staff Routes**: cashier, stock, expenses  
- **Common Routes**: profile, logout (via auth.php)
