## üêõ **RESOLVED BUGS DETAILED**

### **Bug #1-6: Delete Functionality Issues** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: "Swal is not defined" errors preventing deletions

- **Status**: All delete operations now work perfectly with proper confirmation dialogs

### **Bug #7: Unwanted Sales Report Alert** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

- **Root Cause**: Alert::success() called during mount() method
- **Solution**: Created separate generateReportSilently() method for initial loads
- **Status**: Alerts now only appear when user actively generates reports

### **Bug #8: Transaction Completion Failure** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: "Selesaikan transaksi" button not responding to clicks
- **Root Cause**: Missing payment validation allowing invalid transactions
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive frontend and backend payment validation
- **Status**: Transaction completion now works with proper payment validation

- **Status**: Users now receive clear, detailed feedback on stock operations

### **Bug #10: Expense Property Warning** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Console warning about missing expense_date property

## üîç **TECHNICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED**

### **SweetAlert Integration Pattern** ‚úÖ DOCUMENTED
```javascript
// Universal pattern for all delete components
function waitForSwal(callback) {
    if (typeof window.Swal !== 'undefined') {
        callback();
    } else {
        setTimeout(() => waitForSwal(callback), 100);
    }
}

// Usage in all components
waitForSwal(() => {
    document.addEventListener('livewire:init', () => {
        Livewire.on('confirm-delete', (event) => {
            // SweetAlert confirmation dialog
        });
    });
});
```

### **Payment Validation Pattern** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Frontend**: Disable button when payment insufficient
- **Backend**: Validate payment amount before processing
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for invalid payments

### **Silent Operations Pattern** ‚úÖ ESTABLISHED
- **Initial Loading**: Use silent methods for mount() operations
- **User Actions**: Use regular methods with success alerts
- **Consistency**: Apply pattern across all report components
